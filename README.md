# WCSAExploitHub
This repo contains the components that make up the locally hosted Western Cyber Security Association Exploit Hub. It servers for an easy setup process for our raspberry pi's. This is a server portal that hosts vulnerable web applications as well as some general information and suggestions for how members can spend their time during sessions.
