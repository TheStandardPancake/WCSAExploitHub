# WCSAExploitHub
This repo contains the components that make up the locally hosted Western Cyber Security Association Exploit Hub. It serves for an easy setup process for our raspberry pi's. This is a server portal that hosts vulnerable web applications as well as some general information and suggestions for how members can spend their time during sessions.


# Installation:

1) Move the contents of this repository to the '/var/www/html' file location.

3) Go to the Damn Vulnerable Web Application gthub page and clone the contents of the repo into the 'var/www/html' directory as well.
```
git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git
```

2) Follow the installation and setup processes outlined in the DVWA application and all required dependancies for everything else is covered there. Essentially the only requirements to run the web pages located in this repository are javascript, apache2 and php. 
```
# for those too lazy to go to DVWA page for the dependancy list:

apt update
apt install -y apache2 mariadb-server mariadb-client php php-mysqli php-gd libapache2-mod-php

# Keep in mind that to use the DVWA you also have to setup the sql database 
# but your going to have to go to the DVWA github page for instructions on that :)
```


3) To start up the server, run the following command from the terminal:
```
# To start the service

sudo service apache2 start

# To stop the service

sudo service apache2 stop
```

4) To connect remotely enter the IP address of the raspberry pi into a browser search bar (IP address can be found in the wlan section of the `ifconfig` command)

5) To connect locally simply type 'localhost' into your prefered browser.

# Challenges

The challenges are a series of CTF style problems that reflect some of the most common forms for each challenge category, allowing the club members to gain a quick feel for how they should approach each kind of challenge. Each challenge will only have a brief description of the goal along with some small hints, as these being designed for in person events, I will be there to give some guidance. The Board is were you submit flags so as to update the leaderboard to contain your name for a sense of pride and accomplishment. 

# !IMPORTANT! 
Please do note that the challenge does allow access to the entirety of the server and thus it is possible for participants to wreak havoc, this is intended for deployment on a local sever with only a handful of trusted participants in the room of a regular gathering and would be entirely unsuitable to run on a publicly accessable web server, device containing critical/priviledged information, or any device you cannot allow to be hard reset. This is also the reasoning behind this repository in the first place, so that if needed I can very easily reset the webserver to what it once was, serving as a back up that can allow for a bit of mayhem if need be :)
